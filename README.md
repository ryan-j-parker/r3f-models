### <em>Cardboard moving boxes lie stacked in a corner, with a hammer resting atop. You've just finished hanging your prized artwork on the walls, and you'll definitely put it back in the toolbox later. Where is that toolbox? On one wall is a Japanese woodblock-style print of a popular and timeless cat-based meme, and on the other is a collection of postcards. Also featuring cats. 
#### A tiny spacecraft hovers in the corner for no reason at all, but you appreciate the ambience it adds to the space. You wonder if there are tiny aliens inside. The room is inexplicably lit by three powerful spotlights (also aliens?), casting blinding blue, pink, and yellow light over the sofa. Or couch. Or, if you're 150 years old, the "davenport." A loveseat maybe? Who names these things? 
#### Further complicating the scene is an old-timey barber's chair, a curious addition, although a very bold choice in home decor, you think to yourself. On the console sits a marble bust of an anonymous olive enthusiast with sassy bangs, alongside a lantern from your lighthouse-keeping days. There's some foliage around too, harvested from the finest polyethylene orchards.</em>
